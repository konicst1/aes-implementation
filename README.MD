This repository contains the following implementations of AES-128 in C / C++.

1. AES-128 simple, no padding
2. AES-128 32bit, optimized for 32b architectures using T-boxes
3. AES-128 NI, optimized using AESNI new instructions
4. AES-128 for ARM, simple and 32 bit versions.

**NOTE THAT THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS MEANT TO BE USED ONLY FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AES CIPHER
THIS IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**
